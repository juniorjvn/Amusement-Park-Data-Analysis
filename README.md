# Dino Fun World Operational Analysis
### Directions

The database provided by the park administration is formatted to be readable by any SQL database library. The course staff recommends the sqlite3 library. The database contains three tables, named 'checkin', 'attractions', and 'sequences'. The database file is named 'dinofunworld.db'. 

The information contained in each of these tables is listed below:

`checkin`:
    - The check-in data for all visitors for the day in the park. The data includes two types of check-ins: inferred and actual checkins.
    - Fields: visitorID, timestamp, attraction, duration, type
`attraction`:
    - The attractions in the park by their corresponding AttractionID, Name, Region, Category, and type. Regions are from the VAST Challenge map such as Coaster Alley, Tundra Land, etc. Categories include Thrill rides, Kiddie Rides, etc. Type is broken into Outdoor Coaster, Other Ride, Carousel, etc.
    - Fields: AttractionID, Name, Region, Category, type
`sequences`:
    - The check-in sequences of visitors. These sequences list the position of each visitor to the park every five minutes. If the visitor has not entered the part yet, the sequence has a value of 0 for that time interval. If the visitor is in the park, the sequence lists the attraction they have most recently checked in to until they check in to a new one or leave the park.
    - Fields: visitorID, sequence

Using the provided data, answer the four questions that the administrators have asked. Must create a SQL query for to answer each question.

## Part 1
### Description

The administrators of a small amusement park in your hometown has ask a few questions about their park operations. The dataset that they provided for you to perform the requested analysis includes the movement and communication data captured from the park attendees' apps during one weekend (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday).

The administrators would like you to answer four relatively simple questions about the park activities on the day in question. These questions all deal with park operations and can be answered using the data provided.

Question 1: What is the most popular attraction to visit in the park?

Question 2: What ride (note that not all attractions are rides) has the longest average visit time?

Question 3: Which Fast Food offering has the fewest visitors?

Question 4: Compute the Skyline of number of visits and visit time for the park's ride, and report the rides that appear in the Skyline. (Note: Your answer should be three points, which can be given in any order.)

## Part 2: Graphing
### Description

Impressed by your previous work, the administrators of Dino Fun World have asked you to create some charts that they can use in their next presentation to upper management.

The administrators would like you to create four graphs:

Chart 1: A pie chart depicting visits to thrill ride attractions.

Chart 2: A bar chart depicting total visits to food stalls.

* Please query attractions with Category equal to "Food".

Chart 3: A line chart depicting attendance at the newest ride, Atmosfear over the course of the day.

* For this question, use data from the table "sequences". You can assume that all activity sequences are aligned by time (i.e., the first node of all sequences occurred at the same time) and are of the same length.

* You only need to consider the first 16 hours of records in the sequences, which is considered the open hours of the park in one day. Specifically, because an activity sequence from the "sequences" table was updated/recorded every 5 minutes, you need to extract the first 192 items (16h * 60m / 5m = 192).

* Your data list (which will be printed) must be in the format of tuple list (or list of lists). The first item in tuples is irrelevant, but you can put in some meaningful information. The second item is the count of visits at that moment. For example, your output should look like this (in Python syntax; not relevant to the correct answer): [ (0, 0), (1, 7), (2, 3), â€¦, (190, 4), (191, 5) ].

Chart 4: A box-and-whisker plot depicting total visits to the park's Kiddie Rides.

* The to-be-printed, the  data list must be ordered by AttractionID (a field in the table "attraction").

## Part 3: Analysis
### Assignment Description

The administrators of Dino Fun World, a local amusement park, have asked you, one of their data analysts, to perform three data analysis tasks for their park. These tasks will involve understanding, analyzing, and graphing attendance data for three days of the park's operations that the park has provided for you to use. They have provided the data in the form of a database.

Part 1: The park's administrators would like your help understanding the different paths visitors take through the park and different rides they visit. In this mission, they have selected five (5) visitors at random whose check-in sequences they would like you to analyze. For now, they would like you to construct a distance matrix for these five visitors. The five visitors have the IDs: 165316, 1835254, 296394, 404385, and 448990.

Part 2: The park's administrators would like to understand the attendance dynamics at each ride (note that not all attractions are rides). They would like to see the minimum (non-zero) attendance at each ride, the average attendance over the whole day, and the maximum attendance for each ride in a parallel coordinate plot.

Part 3: In addition to a parallel coordinate plot, the administrators would like to see a scatterplot matrix depicting the minimum, average, and maximum attendance for each ride as above.

## Part 4: Time Series Analysis
### Assignment Description

The administrators of Dino Fun World, a local amusement park, have asked you, one of their data analysts, to perform three data analysis tasks for the park. These tasks will involve understanding, analyzing, and graphing attendance data that the park has provided for you to use in the form of a database.

Part 1: The park's administrators are worried about the attendance at the ride 'Atmosfear' in the data window. To assuage their fears, they have asked you to create a control chart of the total attendance at this ride. Using the provided data, create a control chart displaying the attendance, mean, and standard deviation bands at one and two standard deviations.

Part 2: Some of the park's administrators are having trouble interpreting the control chart graph of 'Atmosfear' attendance, so they ask you to also provide a moving average chart of the attendance in addition to the control chart created in Part 1. In this case, they request that you use 50 samples for the size of the moving average window.

Part 3: In order to have options concerning the graphs presented, the park's administrators also ask you to provide a 50-sample moving average window with the average computed with exponential weighting (i.e., an exponentially weighted moving average) over the same 'Atmosfear' attendance data.

# Part 5: Hierarchical Clustering

### Assignment Description

As in your previous assignments, the administrators of the Dino Fun World theme park have asked you, one of their data analysts, to perform a data analysis task in order to help them administer the park. In this case, your task builds upon one of the tasks the administrators previously asked you to perform. In a prior task, you were asked to find the distance between a set of visitor trajectories using a simple edit distance algorithm and report the distances. For this task, you must construct and display a dendrogram of those distances. Again, the administrators of the park have provided a database which contains the information needed.

This assignment consists of only one task, which is to generate a dendrogram. Create this dendrogram using the trajectories of the visitors with the IDs: 165316, 1835254, 296394, 404385, and 448990. When performing clustering over the trajectories to inform the dendrogram, use an average distance over all points in the cluster.
